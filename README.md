# Running a Data-Analytics-Engineering-Platform-Science Team
This guide is meant to help you run a data engineering team. By data engineering team, I mean any team that has at least one data engineer on board. I know that’s vague, but that’s the nature of the game, whether you call it analytics, data science, or data platform.

Data engineering teams cover lots of different kinds of functions to very different degrees:

- Data engineering at its core - building and running complete data pipelines
- Analytics engineering - transforming data (often using SQL)
- Platform engineering - running data orchestrators BI tools and providing data products to other teams
- Analytics - providing insights, dashboards, and reports to decision makers.

This guide tries to cover most of these functions and, in addition, all metafunctions.
